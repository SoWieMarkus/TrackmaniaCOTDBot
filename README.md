## How does it work?

I am using the the API trackmania.io by <a href="https://github.com/codecat">CodeCat</a>. If you want to use this API for your own projects, <a href="https://github.com/codecat">CodeCat</a> allowes the usage of the API under the following conditions:

* The API is unsupported. If CodeCat remove/change something, CodeCat will (likely) not give notice of it, and you'll have to deal with it yourself.
* The API is undocumented. You're on your own to figure out how the API works and what you need from it.
* Use a proper user agent header so that CodeCat can see how you're using the API.
* There are no hard limitations in place, so please be respectful of CodeCat's server resources as well as Nadeo's. Cache stuff! Please let CodeCat know if you're planning to do any kind of "bulk" requests!
* Let CodeCat know what you're working on! CodeCat is always curious and it lets CodeCat understand how people are using the API and who to contact about certain things if any contact is needed.

If you're still unsure about your use of the API, feel free to DM Miss#8888 with any further questions.
